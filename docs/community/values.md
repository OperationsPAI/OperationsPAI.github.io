# OperationsPAI Core Values

These values guide our community, technical decisions, and interactions.

## 1. Open by Default

**Transparency in everything we do**

- **Open Source**: All code, data, and algorithms are publicly available
- **Open Discussions**: Technical decisions made in public forums
- **Open Data**: Datasets and benchmarks freely accessible
- **Open Research**: Papers, results, and methodologies shared openly

**Why it matters**: Trust is built through transparency. Open collaboration accelerates innovation.

## 2. Research Meets Practice

**Bridge the gap between academia and industry**

- **Academic Rigor**: Scientifically sound methodologies and evaluation
- **Production Ready**: Code that works in real systems, not just papers
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments can be replicated
- **Real-World Impact**: Solutions that solve actual problems

**Why it matters**: Too many research papers never make it to production. We build for both.

## 3. Community First

**Success is measured by community growth, not individual achievement**

- **Inclusive**: Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels
- **Collaborative**: Share knowledge, help each other succeed
- **Recognition**: Celebrate all contributions, big and small
- **Mentorship**: Experienced members guide newcomers

**Why it matters**: A strong community outlasts any individual contributor.

## 4. Quality Over Speed

**Do it right, not just fast**

- **Code Quality**: Clean, tested, documented code
- **Data Quality**: Accurate labels, validated datasets
- **Review Process**: Thorough code review before merging
- **Technical Debt**: Address it proactively, don't accumulate

**Why it matters**: Shortcuts today become blockers tomorrow. Quality compounds.

## 5. Pragmatic Innovation

**Balance cutting-edge research with practical constraints**

- **Proven Technologies**: Use battle-tested tools when possible
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, working steps over big rewrites
- **User Needs**: Solve real problems, not hypothetical ones
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones

**Why it matters**: Innovation without pragmatism leads to abandoned projects.

## 6. Continuous Learning

**Embrace experimentation and learn from failures**

- **Fail Fast**: Try new ideas, learn quickly from mistakes
- **Share Learnings**: Document what works and what doesn't
- **Iterate**: Improve continuously based on feedback
- **Stay Curious**: Keep exploring new approaches

**Why it matters**: The best solutions emerge through experimentation and iteration.

## 7. Respect and Empathy

**Treat everyone with dignity and understanding**

- **Assume Good Intent**: Give others the benefit of the doubt
- **Constructive Feedback**: Critique ideas, not people
- **Patient Teaching**: Remember everyone was a beginner once
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Value different viewpoints and experiences

**Why it matters**: A respectful community attracts and retains the best contributors.

## 8. Sustainability

**Build for the long term**

- **Maintainability**: Write code that others can understand and modify
- **Documentation**: Invest in clear, comprehensive docs
- **Funding**: Seek sustainable funding models
- **Burnout Prevention**: Respect contributors' time and energy

**Why it matters**: Projects die when maintainers burn out. We build to last.

## Living These Values

### In Code Reviews
- Provide constructive, specific feedback
- Acknowledge good work
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Be patient with newcomers

### In Discussions
- Listen actively to different perspectives
- Back opinions with data and reasoning
- Admit when you're wrong
- Focus on solutions, not blame

### In Community Interactions
- Welcome new members warmly
- Answer questions patiently
- Share knowledge generously
- Celebrate others' successes

### In Technical Decisions
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Prioritize user needs
- Balance innovation with stability
- Document trade-offs clearly

## When Values Conflict

Sometimes values may appear to conflict (e.g., quality vs. speed, innovation vs. pragmatism). In these cases:

1. **Discuss Openly**: Bring the conflict to the community
2. **Context Matters**: Different situations may prioritize different values
3. **Seek Balance**: Look for solutions that honor multiple values
4. **Learn and Adapt**: Use conflicts as learning opportunities

## Upholding Our Values

Everyone in the community is responsible for upholding these values:

- **Lead by Example**: Model the behavior you want to see
- **Speak Up**: Address violations respectfully
- **Support Others**: Help community members live these values
- **Continuous Improvement**: Suggest ways to better embody our values
