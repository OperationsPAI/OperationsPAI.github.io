# OperationsPAI Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our vision for building a self-evolving RCA training ecosystem.

## Vision

Create the world's first **self-evolving end-to-end model training environment** for Root Cause Analysis in microservices, where intelligent fault injection continuously generates challenging scenarios to improve RCA algorithms.

## Timeline Overview

```
2026 Q1-Q2: Foundation & Community Launch
2026 Q3-Q4: Intelligent Loop & First Users
```

## Phase 1: Foundation (2026 Q1-Q2)

**Goal**: Establish community infrastructure and complete the basic training loop

### Community Infrastructure

- [ ] Official website (operationspai.github.io)
- [ ] Documentation portal
- [ ] Social media presence (Twitter, LinkedIn)

### Technical Foundation
- [ ] Complete end-to-end demo (30-minute quick start)
- [ ] Clean up hardcoded configurations
- [ ] Standardize data formats across components
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### Documentation
- [ ] Quick Start guide (30 minutes to first result)
- [ ] Architecture overview
- [ ] Component-specific guides
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Video tutorials

### Community Engagement
- [ ] 20+ Good First Issues across repositories
- [ ] Contributor onboarding guide
- [ ] First community call
- [ ] Seed user recruitment (5-10 early adopters)

**Success Metrics**:
- 50+ GitHub stars across repositories
- 10+ external contributors
- 5+ seed users running experiments
- Complete documentation coverage

## Phase 2: Intelligent Loop (2026 Q3-Q4)

**Goal**: Close the self-evolving feedback loop with intelligent fault scheduling

### Intelligent Fault Injection
- [ ] Genetic algorithm optimization (Pandora)
- [ ] Multi-objective fitness function tuning
- [ ] Fault scenario diversity metrics
- [ ] Automated difficulty progression
- [ ] Fault library expansion

### Data Pipeline
- [ ] Automated trace collection and labeling

- [ ] Standardized evaluation metrics
- [ ] Leaderboard system
- [ ] Algorithm comparison notebooks
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning framework

### Microservices Expansion
- [ ] ERP system integration (planned)
- [ ] E-commerce benchmark
- [ ] Media streaming benchmark
- [ ] Custom system integration guide

**Success Metrics**:
- Intelligent loop demonstrates 20%+ improvement in algorithm performance
- 3+ external RCA algorithms integrated
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 20+ active contributors
- First research paper submitted
