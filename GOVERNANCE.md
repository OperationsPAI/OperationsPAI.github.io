# OperationsPAI Governance

This document describes the governance model for the OperationsPAI community.

## Current Stage: Bootstrap Phase

OperationsPAI is in its early bootstrap phase (2026-2027). During this period, governance is intentionally lightweight to enable rapid iteration and experimentation.

## Governance Principles

### 1. Meritocracy
Influence is earned through contributions, not granted by title.

### 2. Transparency
Decisions are made openly with community input.

### 3. Inclusivity
All voices are heard, especially from diverse backgrounds and use cases.

### 4. Pragmatism
We prioritize working solutions over perfect processes.
